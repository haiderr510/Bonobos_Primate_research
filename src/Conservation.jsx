        <h2>The Conservation Crisis</h2>

            <p>
              Bonobos are confronted by an unprecedented conservation crisis that threatens their very existence. With the bonobo as one of our closest
              living relatives, their extinction would be not only a biological catastrophe, but a significant loss to understanding human evolution and human behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main threats are habitat loss due to logging and agriculture, bushmeat hunting,
              and political instability in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Climate change also adds to these threats by modifying the fragile environments bonobos must inhabit.

          These sobering facts demonstrate the urgent need for conservation action at once. If not acted on, we could see the extinction of our nearest relatives in a decadeâ€”a disaster that would be irreversible and both scientifically and biologically costly.

          <div>
            <p>
              In spite of all this, committed conservation groups and scientists are labelling hard to save bonobos. These include setting up protected reserves, cooperating with the population to create sustainable livelihoods, and carrying out important research to inform conservation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Bonobo Conservation Initiative, Lukuru Wildlife Research Foundation, and other institutions have contributed well in terms of habitat protection and community engagement. Through their endeavors, it becomes clear that with enough support and resources, bonobo populations can be stabilized as well as recovered.
            </p>
            <p>
              Awareness and education programs have also been effective in alleviating pressure on hunting and gaining local support for conservation. Engaging the local population in conservation efforts and offering economic substitutes, the programs establish long-term protection for bonobos and their environment.

        <h2>Statistical Analysis: Demonstrating Conservation Need</h2>

        <h3>Population Decline Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          Using data by Fruth et al. (2016) and recent surveys, bonobo population has experienced catastrophic decline:
        </p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Habitat Loss Statistics</h3>
        <p>
          Hickey et al. (2013) research and recent satellite images reveal dire rates of habitat loss:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ lineHeight: '1.8', fontSize: '1.1rem', marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
          <li><strong>Forest Cover Loss:</strong> 75% of original forest lost since 1980</li>
          <li><strong>Fragmentation:</strong> Remaining habitat fragmented into 180+ isolated remnants</li>
          <li><strong>Protected Area Coverage:</strong> Only 12% of bonobo range officially protected</li>
          <li><strong>Annual Deforestation:</strong> 0.2-0.5% of remaining habitat lost each year</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Study of "Impending Extinction Crisis of the World's Primates"</h3>
        <p>
          Primates are, Estrada et al. (2017) claim, more than ever before at threat around the globe, and bonobos make a most urgent case study:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ lineHeight: '1.8', fontSize: '1.1rem', marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
          <li><strong>Extinction Risk:</strong> 60% of the threatened primate species</li>
          <li><strong>Population Decline:</strong> 75% of species with declining populations</li>
          <li><strong>Great Ape Crisis:</strong> All great ape species except for human beings are at risk of extinction</li>
          <li><strong>Conservation Gap:</strong> Funding shortfall reaching 87% of endangered species</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Economic Analysis of Conservation Need</h3>
        <p>
          Cost-benefit analysis illustrates that urgent conservation action is economically warranted:
        </p>
        <div className="section-with-image">
          <div>
            <p>
              <strong>Conservation Costs:</strong> Preserving remaining bonobo habitat would cost around $50 million per year for park management, community schemes, and anti-poaching operations.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Economic Benefits:</strong> Congo Basin forest ecosystem services (biodiversity, carbon, water regulation) worth $3.7 trillion. Conservation of bonobos preserves these services and stimulates sustainable eco-tourism worth $200 million potential yearly revenue.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Cost of Inaction:</strong> Total extinction would cause permanent loss of species with key secrets to human evolution, and forest ecosystems supporting 10 million people.

        </div>

        <h3>Education Intervention Evidence</h3>
        <p>
          Research confirms that community conservation programs greatly enhance the result of conservation:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ lineHeight: '1.8', fontSize: '1.1rem' }}>
          <li><strong>Hunting Reduction:</strong> Education programs cut bonobo hunting by 60-80% in target villages</li>
          <li><strong>Habitat Protection:</strong> Forests maintained by communities have 90% less deforestation than forests without management</li>
          <li><strong>Economic Returns:</strong> Conservation education provides alternative incomes to 70% of students</li>
          <li><strong>Attitude Change:</strong> 85% of students report greater awareness of conservation significance</li>
        </ul>
