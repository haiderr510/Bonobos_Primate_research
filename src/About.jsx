        <p>
          Hi! I'm Haidar Rajabi, an avid researcher interested in the conservation of primates. My passion for bonobos is close to heart â€“ I researched them because their name reminds me of the individual who struggled through a challenge that I too had to struggle through during a different time in my life when I also had to struggle through the difficult periods. This close-to-heart passion conceived my academic interest in their unusual social organizations as well as in the grave conservation issues that face them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this research project, I aim to create more awareness of the conservation crisis facing bonobos and be part of humanity's attempt to preserve these wonderful primates. As bonobos demonstrate resilience and conflict resolution in peace among communities, I believe learning about and protecting our closest relatives in the primate kingdom is vital to maintaining biodiversity and learning useful lessons on how to transcend adversity.
